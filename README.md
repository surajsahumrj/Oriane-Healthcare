## 👨‍💻 Credits

This project was designed and developed by **Suraj Sahu**


Would you like me to make this README **more client-oriented** (marketing tone, less technical details) so it looks like a project delivery note, or **developer-oriented** (keeps the tech stack and setup instructions for future maintenance)?
